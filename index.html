            When you use a free online service, <em>you</em> are their product. Scores of people have access to confidential correspondence and personal information you share. Our goal is to push back by offering easy and portable encryption controled only by you. This tool will enable users to send and receive messages via online platforms visible to the sender and receiver(s) but hidden from the platforms that host them. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Corporations can collude with governments to control what we <em>can</em> think and express but also suppress our ideas based upon their own political leanings. It is the nature of institutions to maintain order on their platform at the expense of individual rights. But free people must let their voices be heard. Once our thoughts become caged within the walls of those with power as opposed to the natural limits of a free and functioning society of empowered human beings, we've lost something that cannot be returned. Freedom of thought is precious, like childhood innocence.

          <details id="how" open>
            <summary>how does it work?</summary>
            <p>It's basically a cipher. A book or other stable body of text is loaded into the app, and each word is given a code in the order that it is received that coresponds to a special character (part of utf8). This code is then scrambled by the source text itself. It is impossible to read your messages without knowing the source of the cipher. Future version will allow multiple cipher sources.</p>
            <p>The source of the cipher needs to be secret, something shared by the user and anybody who wants to read the messages, but not shared by anyone else. Since they are text files, they can exist on your computer or phone without calling attention. Keep them secret.</p>
            <p>Once the source file is loaded, it will be cached by the app, so you can delete the file, if the situation demands it.</p>
